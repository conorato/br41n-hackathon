This project aims to classify, in real time, whether a hand is closed or open based on 7 channels EEG. The classification is then sent to a Unity hand model.

## Classification

We have based our training on two different datasets. First one is the dataset published with a paper written by Hohyun Cho, Minkyu Ahn, Sangtae Ahn, named "EEG datasets for motor imagery brainâ€“computer interface" (see [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5493744/?report=classic)). The dataset consists of 52 recordings for one suject each. The corresponding dataset can be found [here](ftp://parrot.genomics.cn/gigadb/pub/10.5524/100001_101000/100295/mat_data/).
